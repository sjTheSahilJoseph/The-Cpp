    // Comments.
    // Comments are the way to write some text in code file that don't run.
    // Comments can be very useful add some important information about code in code file.
    // In fact, this is also a comment.

    // There are 2 types of comments in C++.
    // 1. Single Line Comments.
    // 2. Multiline Comments.

    // Single Line Comments.
        // It is a single line comment which comments out only one line. Before I go to new line, whatever I write here is a comment and will never run.
        // For writing a singleline comment, I need to add // at start of the comment and then start writing.
    
    // Multiline Comment.
        /*
            It is multiline comment,
            I can go to as much new lines as I want.
            But only in comment block.
            To start a multiline comment, I need to open a block by:
            /* Like this and close the block like this. */

        // Comment in Action:
        
            int a = 5; // This is a variable.

    return 0;
