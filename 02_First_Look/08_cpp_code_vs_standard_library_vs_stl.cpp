    // C++ Core Language Vs Standard Library Vs STL.
    
    // C++ Core Language Feature.
        // C++ Core Language Feature is a basic building block that makes up the C++ programming.
        // For Example:
            // Defining the Variable.
            // Calling a Function.
            // Syntax stuff.
            // etc...
        // These core things are called C++ Core Language Feature.

    // Standard Library.
        // Standard Library is the library where some useful code is written which we can use in our Program.
            // For Example: 
                // iostream library is used to give us the cout, cin, features.
                // strings library is used to provide us the string features.
                // etc...
    
    // STL.
        // STL is kind of collection of container types.
        // We have algorithms and functions to work on these data types.
        // We have specialized types that are called iterators that allow us to navigate through these containers.
        // Potentially running these algorithms on each element in the collection.
        // STL is highly specialized part of C++.
            // For Example:


    return 0;
